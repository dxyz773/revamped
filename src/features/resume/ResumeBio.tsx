          My journey into software engineering wasn’t exactly traditional, but
          that’s what makes it exciting. With a background in psychology and a
          decade-long career in acting, I’ve always been fascinated by human
          connection and storytelling. That same passion for creativity and
          problem-solving naturally led me to coding, where I get to build
          experiences that people interact with every day.

          Learning JavaScript, React, and Python opened up a whole new world for
          me, and I quickly fell in love with the process of turning ideas into
          functional, beautifully designed applications. Whether it was building
          Petite Leaf, an e-commerce site for plant lovers, or creating a
          game-inspired app like Camp Retro, I’ve found so much joy in crafting
          engaging digital spaces. Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into
          TypeScript, SQL, and NoSQL databases to expand my skill set and make
          my applications even more scalable and efficient.

          But beyond the code, what really excites me is collaboration. I love
          working with diverse teams, tackling challenges together, and seeing a
          project come to life. Leading Mind Matters during the Women Who Code
          Hackathon was a huge growth moment for me—I wasn’t just writing
          frontend code, I was guiding a remote team, organizing schedules, and
          helping debug tricky issues through pair programming. It reminded me
          of my theater days, where every moving part needed to come together
          for a great performance. Whether mentoring new developers, reviewing
          code, or brainstorming solutions, I thrive in environments where
          creativity and teamwork go hand in hand. My path has been anything but
          linear, but that’s what makes it mine.
